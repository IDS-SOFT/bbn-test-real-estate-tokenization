Project Overview
This project is a Node.js application built with Express that interacts with an Ethereum blockchain smart contract. It enables functionalities such as distributing dividends, withdrawing dividends, and transferring tokens. It also includes a user authentication system for secure access to the blockchain operations.

Features
User registration and login with MongoDB database integration.
Interactions with a smart contract using ethers.js.
Endpoints for distributing dividends, withdrawing dividends, and transferring tokens.
Secure and structured API routes with JWT-based authentication.
Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14.x or later)
MongoDB (local setup or MongoDB Atlas)
Postman (for API testing)
Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://your-repository-url
cd real-estate-token
Install Dependencies

Navigate to your project directory and install the required npm packages:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory of your project and define the necessary environment variables:

plaintext
Copy code
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
RPC_URL=https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/your_infura_api_key
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=deployed_contract_address
Replace the placeholders with your actual data. Ensure the RPC_URL points to an Ethereum network node, and the PRIVATE_KEY is kept secure.

Running the Server
To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
node src/server.js
This will launch the server on http://localhost:3000 (or another port if specified in .env).

API Endpoints
User Authentication

Register: POST /api/auth/register
Body: { "username": "user", "password": "password" }
Login: POST /api/auth/login
Body: { "username": "user", "password": "password" }
Blockchain Interactions

Distribute Dividends: POST /api/blockchain/distribute-dividends
Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body: { "amount": "1.0" }
Withdraw Dividends: POST /api/blockchain/withdraw-dividends
Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Transfer Tokens: POST /api/blockchain/transfer-tokens
Header: Authorization: Bearer <token>
Body: { "to": "0xAddress", "amount": 100 }
Testing
Use Postman or any other API client to test the endpoints. Ensure you include the correct headers and body data as required.

Security Considerations
Never expose your .env file or include sensitive keys in your version-controlled source code.
Regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.
Implement rate limiting and logging for better security and monitoring.
